            Wrapped Now is a passion project based off of the service Spotify's yearly Wrapped.
            At the end of every year, Spotify releases Spotify Wrapped,
            a collection of the user's top songs, artists, genres, and more.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white;">
            I wanted to recreate this feature, but be able to see what your current top songs or artists were right at this moment.
            Using Spotify's API, I made Wrapped Now.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="color:white;">
            There are other projects already out on the internet that also show your top songs and artists, but I the main reason I wanted
            to make Wrapped Now was to show the user's current minutes listened. Spotify Wrapped shows how many minutes of music someone
            has listened to at the end of the year, and people like to share how many minutes they've listened to with their friends to brag about
            their big numbers. I wanted to make Wrapped Now a checkpoint website, to see how many minutes you've racked up before the year ended,
            but then I realized it's more difficult than I thought to get the minutes, as Spotify doesn't give that information openly on the API.
            Wrapped Now is a semi failed passion project, just making the best of what I got.
