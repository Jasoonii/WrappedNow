                Introducing Wrapped Now - a project born out of my admiration for Spotify's annual Wrapped service. 
                While Spotify Wrapped provides a retrospective look at your top songs, artists, and genres over the entire year, 
                I aspired to offer a real-time experience, allowing users to discover their current favorite songs and artists 
                in the moment. Leveraging Spotify's API, I bring you Wrapped Now.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although there are existing projects online that showcase your musical preferences, my primary motivation for 
                creating Wrapped Now was to unveil a unique metric - your current minutes listened. Inspired by the popular year-end
                tradition of sharing Spotify Wrapped statistics, I envisioned Wrapped Now as a checkpoint website, 
                enabling users to boast about their accumulated listening minutes throughout the year.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Yet, the path to obtaining this real-time minutes data proved more challenging than anticipated. Spotify's API 
                doesn't openly disclose this information, leading to Wrapped Now being a semi-failed passion project. 
                Despite the hurdles, I've embraced the opportunity to make the best out of the situation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Wrapped Now may not have achieved all its intended goals, but it stands as a testament to the journey of experimentation,
                learning, and adapting to the complexities of API interactions. Join me on this musical adventure, 
                and let's celebrate the joy of discovery, even in the face of unexpected challenges.
